👋 Hi, I’m @appsecahmedusa

👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and developing secure applications. I have a particular fascination with web application security and the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. I love exploring new tools and technologies that enhance security postures and protect digital assets.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced penetration testing techniques and diving deep into cloud security best practices and developing digital stratergies. I'm also expanding my knowledge in secure coding practices to better understand how to integrate security throughout the software development lifecycle.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security projects, particularly those focused on web and cloud application security. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to tools that help developers and security professionals identify and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out to me via GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always open to discussions on security topics, project collaborations, or simply exchanging ideas and experiences in the field of cybersecurity.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: Aside from my passion for cybersecurity, I'm an avid thinker. The name "appsecahmedusa" combines my professional interest in application security (appsec) with my fascination for the mesmerizing and almost alien forms of jellyfish (ahmedusa, a play on "medusa," which is another term for jellyfish). Just like in the ocean, navigating the digital world requires awareness and respect for the unseen, and I find this parallel between my hobby and profession both intriguing and inspiring.
